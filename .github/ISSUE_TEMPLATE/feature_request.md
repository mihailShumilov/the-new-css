**Describe the feature**
A clear description of the utility or improvement you'd like.

**Use case**
What problem does this solve? Provide an example of HTML/CSS where this would be useful.

**Proposed class names**
If applicable, suggest class names following existing conventions (e.g., `bg-*`, `text-*`, `flex-*`).

**Size impact**
Have you considered the 5KB gzipped budget? Is this utility commonly needed enough to justify inclusion?

**Alternatives**
Are there existing utilities or plain CSS that could achieve the same result?
